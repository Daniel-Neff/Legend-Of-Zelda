SPRINT 3 REFLECTION

- Sprint Task Assignments
  * Decided on 02/25/21
  * Sprint split into following tasks: player collision, enemy collision, new projectile enemy, new projectile item, level-loading, new movable blocks
 
- Overall team performance compared to Sprint2:
  * Each individual member contributed to the project and worked on their tasks.
  * For last sprint, we only worked on our own tasks and there were little interactions between team members.
  * For this sprint, we all have found the momentum to work together.
  * We, as a team, work with each other to get different functionalities done and help each other out when they get stuck.
  * We arrange meetings and live share sessions to work together.
  * We implemented Sprint3 in a much more efficient way than Sprint2. 
  
- Changes made during this sprint
  * Player collision with blocks and enemies and map boarders.
  * Player items and sword collision with enemies.
  * Player takes damages by colliding into enemies or hit by enemies.
  * Enemies take damges by colliding into player's sword and player's item.
  * Levels of map implemented with JSON file.
  * Mouse right-click command to cycle through different levels of map.
  * Added movable blocks.
  
- Things aimed to be done differently next time
  * Start on the tasks early and formulate a planned approach
  * Have a better burndown chart so that everyone can track the progress visually and help each other out
