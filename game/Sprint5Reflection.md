- Overall team performance compared to Sprint4:

  * We did better in creating and distributing tasks in Azure DevOps this sprint but still need improvement.

- Things aimed to be done differently next time (Even though it is the last Sprint)
  * Start on the tasks early and formulate a planned approach
  * Do a better job in distributing tasks in Azure DevOps so that everyone can track the progress visually and help each other out
  * Members from different "department" can work together for certain functionality and help each others out.
