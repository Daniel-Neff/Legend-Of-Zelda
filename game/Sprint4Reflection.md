# SPRINT 4 REFLECTION

- Sprint Task Assignments
  * Decided on 03/16/2021
  * Sprint split into following tasks: 
    * Game Music & Sound Effect;
    * Transitioning between rooms;
    * The winning game state on grabbing the triforce piece;
    * Pausing;
    * The game over screen;
    * The item selection screen;
    * Implement resetting the level upon the player character's death;
    * Have a scrolling transition between rooms and the item selection menu;
 
- Overall team performance compared to Sprint4:
  * Each individual member contributed to the project and worked on their tasks.
  * For last sprint, we mostly worked on our assigned tasks and there were less interference between team members.
  * For this sprint, we have a higher momentum to work together.
  * We, as a team, work with each other to get different functionalities done and help each other out when they get stuck.
  * We arrange meetings and live share sessions to work together.
  * We implemented Sprint3 in a much more efficient way than Sprint2. 
  
- Changes made during this sprint
  * Player collision with blocks and enemies and map boarders.
  * Player items and sword collision with enemies.
  * Player takes damages by colliding into enemies or hit by enemies.
  * Enemies take damges by colliding into player's sword and player's item.
  * Levels of map implemented with JSON file.
  * Mouse right-click command to cycle through different levels of map.
  * Added movable blocks.
  
- Things aimed to be done differently next time
  * Start on the tasks early and formulate a planned approach
  * Have a better burndown chart so that everyone can track the progress visually and help each other out

# Progression and Burndown 

- The first 2 weeks in sprint 3 are saturated with midterms, projects and labs, so most members were rather occupied.
- Minor technique issues encountered during the process, including remote share session and commit conflict.
