For code's Readability: Variables and functions have clear names but are sometimes repetitive. Could have more comments explaining the functions and procedures through the file. 

For codes' Maintainability: The code is highly maintainable since very few magic numbers are used and most of the looping is done dynamically.  

A hypothetical change:

There are a lot of functions in the class so a detailed workflow of what function calls what and how the class works would be helpful. 
More commenting across the file to explain some really long arrays.
Remove some variables and functions not used.
