That's the 4rd peer review of the project and again, there's not much new stuff to say, especially since it's another item with much of the code inherited from previous .  

# Readability

As having seen items for 2 months, these code are very easy to understand. 

# Maintainability

All good. 

# Hypothetical change

* `OUT_OF_MAP`, as something used by almost all enemies and items should be have a larger scope. So does the same field in other classes. 
* A problem in most of the item and enemy class: haveing too many duplications while not a lot is differet. Consider merging the classes with same feature as one, 
and only passin different parameters to make necessary changes. 
* not perticularly the problem of this file but it contributed to it: `SpriteFactory` is doing way too much, more than what the name might suggest. 
It has not only `Texture2D` generation, but ISprite, IBlocks as well, it can even change game and player states. Consider dividing them into parts.
