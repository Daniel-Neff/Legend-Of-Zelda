For code's Readability: Code is simple and easy to follow. code is well commented and understandable.

For codes' Maintainability: Code is easy to change effect/position. Another shop item could be easily created using a similar format.

A hypothetical change: 
Lots of unused methods. A great deal of refactoring could allow for abstract classes or interfaces for collectable items that are not used by the player (i.e. RubyItem). 
Playtesting could allow for prices to be balanced against collection rate for rupies and prices in upgrades overlay.
